# Model Weights File Description

## Overview
This file contains the pre-trained weights of the neural network model with special parameters and architecture.

## File Format
The weights are stored in a binary format suitable for the PyTorch deep learning framework. Each file typically contains a state dictionary that maps each layer of the neural network to its respective parameters.

## Usage
To utilize these pre-trained weights, they can be loaded into a compatible PyTorch model using the `load_state_dict()` method. This ensures that the model architecture matches and can be seamlessly integrated with the pre-trained parameters.
